## Earthquakes

An app to visualise on a 3D Earth model (texture from NASA Visible Earth catalog) all earthquakes detected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_day.geojson) in the past 24h, week, or month, along with historical ones (magnitude superior or equal to 8.5 since 1900).

## Install

1. Download the dmg from the [latest release](https://github.com/Thinkr1/Earthquakes/releases)
2. As I don't have a paid developer account, I cannot direcly notarize the app and you'll be presented with an alert saying it cannot be opened directly. Here are two options:

a) You can run the following command and then open the app normally: 

```sh
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine /path/to/app/folder/Earthquakes.app
```

b) You can allow the app to be opened in *System Settings > Privacy & Security* by clicking "Open Anyway" for Earthquakes.app:
